# How NCEA Works
### In A Nutshell

 - NCEA Certificate has three levels (L1, L2, L3)
 - Students gain **credits** through internal (in-class assignments) and external (exams) assessments
- Credits can be gained at four different levels
	- Not Achieved (NA)
	- Achieved (A)
	- Merit (M)
	- Excellence (E)

## Achieving Certificates
### Level 1

 - Gain 80 credits at or above level 1, including [literacy and numeracy credits](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/subjects/literacy-and-numeracy/level-1-requirements/) through specified assessment standards.

### Level 2
- Gain 60 credits at or above level 2 + 20 credits from any level. Level 1 literacy and numeracy requirements must also be met.

### Level 3
- Gain 60 credits at or above level 3 + 20 credits from any level. Level 1 literacy and numeracy requirements must also be met.

## Endorsements

NCEA Certificates can be endorsed with **Merit** or **Excellence** if a student achieves more than 50 credits of merit/excellence at the highest level of certificate awarded.
> If a student achieves 40 level 2 credits at merit and 25 level 2 credits at excellence, then the student's level 2 certificate will be endorsed with merit.

Individual courses can also be endorsed with **Achieved**, **Merit** or **Excellence** if a student gains more than 14 credits of the endorsement level in a single school year. 

 - At least 3 credits must be from internally assessed standards and 3 from externally assessed standards.

> If a level 1 physics student achieves 7 internal credits at merit, 1 internal credit at excellence, and another 13 external credits at excellence, then the student will endorse Level 1 Physics at excellence.
